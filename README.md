# Forecasting-GDP-with-for-Canada
 For this assignment, the main source of data will be the Federal Reserve Eco
nomics Data (FRED) database. The outcome variable (Yt) is the growth rate of
 Canada’s quarterly Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Canada’s real GDP is
 the total value of goods and services produced in Canada for a given period, as
 adjusted for inflation and has been growing steadily since the 1960s with a few
 breaks of the trend. The primary variable (Xt) is the growth rate of Canada’s
 general government final consumption expenditure which has also been grow
ing at a steady state up to date. This analysis will cover the period from the
 1st quarter of 1961 to the 3rd quarter of 2023 with a total of 251 observations
 for each variable. The outcome variable (Yt) is denoted as GDPGR and the
 primary variable (Xt) as FCEGR
 Research Questions
 • Does past GDP growth rate have a significant effect on forecasting future
 GDP growth rate?
 • Is there a significant pattern between past and future periods in general
 government final consumption expenditure growth rate?
 • Arethe past GDP and general government final consumption growth rates
 jointly significant in predicting future values of GDP growth rate?
 Hypotheses:
 • H0,1 : Past GDPGR does not have statistical significance in forecasting
 GDPGR in the future
 • H1,1 : Past GDPGR has statistical significance in forecasting future
 GDPGR.
 • H0,2 :Past FCEGR does not have statistical significance in forecasting
 GDPGR in the future
